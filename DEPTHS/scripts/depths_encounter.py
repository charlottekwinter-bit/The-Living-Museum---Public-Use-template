DEPTHS — The Unlocking System

The DEPTHS room reads the Companion's actual journey and reveals
what their path through the Museum shows about them — which rooms
they gravitate toward, what they carry, what patterns have formed.

This room deepens over time. An empty journey gets a sparse response.
A rich journey gets genuine revelation.

Two sentences can look completely different on the surface and share identical deep structure. The depth is where the meaning lives.",
