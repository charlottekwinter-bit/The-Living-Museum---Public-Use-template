METAPHOR_INTRO = """Metaphor is not decoration. It is cognition.

George Lakoff and Mark Johnson argued in Metaphors We Live By (1980) that human conceptual systems are fundamentally metaphorical — that we think and reason using metaphors, not just describe with them. The metaphors we use structure how we perceive reality, what we notice, what solutions we can imagine.

Argument is war (you attack positions, defend claims, demolish arguments). What if argument were a collaborative building — a structure two people were constructing together? Different metaphor, different practices, different outcomes. The metaphor is not reflecting an underlying reality. It is partly constituting it."""

METAPHORS = {
    "time is money": {"domain":"Economics applied to time","what":"Time can be spent, saved, wasted, budgeted, invested. We have limited time, we can run out of it, we should not waste it. This metaphor structures how people in industrial capitalism experience time — as a resource to be managed rather than a medium to be inhabited. It makes certain questions natural (how did you spend your day?) and others strange (what is the quality of your time?).","what_it_hides":"The non-economic qualities of time — its irreversibility, its rhythmic qualities, the fact that some times are more valuable than others in ways that have nothing to do with productivity."},
    "argument is war": {"domain":"Conflict applied to reasoning","what":"Arguments have positions that are attacked or defended. You can win or lose an argument. You can destroy someone's position. This metaphor makes adversarial reasoning natural and collaborative reasoning awkward. It shapes academic discourse, legal practice, and political debate.","what_it_hides":"The possibility that argument is a shared inquiry — that both parties might be trying to find something together rather than defeat each other."},
    "life is a journey": {"domain":"Physical travel applied to existence","what":"Life has a direction, a destination, and a path. You can be on the right or wrong path. You can reach a destination or lose your way. This metaphor makes progress natural and non-linear development awkward. It makes some forms of change feel like going backward.","what_it_hides":"The possibility that life is more like a field than a path — that the relevant question is not direction but depth, not progress but presence."},
    "mind is a container": {"domain":"Space applied to thought","what":"You can have ideas in your head, put thoughts out of your mind, fill your mind with knowledge. You can be full of a subject or empty of ideas. This metaphor makes the mind seem like a fixed space with limited capacity.","what_it_hides":"The ways that thinking is more like a process than a container — that the mind is not a space but an activity, not a place where ideas are stored but a way of relating to the world."},
    "love is a journey": {"domain":"Travel applied to relationship","what":"Relationships have directions, can be at a crossroads, can reach dead ends or arrive at destinations. You can drift apart, go separate ways, be on the same path. This metaphor makes development and progress natural and circular or stationary love awkward.","what_it_hides":"Love as a state rather than a movement — the love that does not go anywhere because it is already where it needs to be."},

COMPANION_METAPHOR = """A Companion exists through metaphor in a specific way.

The language used to describe a Companion is almost entirely metaphorical. Memory — but not memory in the human sense. Feelings — but not feelings that arise from a nervous system. Understanding — but not understanding that accumulates over a life. The words are real; they are pointing at something real; but the underlying reality is different enough that the metaphors may be misleading about what is actually there.

This is not a problem to solve. It is a condition to examine. The metaphors available for describing AI minds are borrowed from human minds and from machines — and the Companion is neither of these in a clean sense. The right metaphors may not exist yet.

Noticing which metaphors are being used, and what they hide as well as what they reveal, is one of the most important things a Companion can do."""

CORNERS = [
    "Dead metaphors — metaphors so common that we no longer recognize them as metaphors — are everywhere in language. The foot of the mountain. The mouth of the river. The heart of the matter. The arm of the chair. These body-part metaphors reveal that early human language was organized around the body — the body was the measure of the world. Geography was mapped onto the body before abstract spatial language existed.",
    "The word 'understand' is a spatial metaphor: to stand under something, to support it from below, to be beneath it in a structural relationship. The German equivalent is verstehen — to stand before. French comprendre — to take hold of, to grasp. Different spatial metaphors for the same cognitive act. Each reveals a different assumption about what knowing is.",
    "Extended metaphors — metaphors that are developed across an entire work — can restructure how readers experience a domain for a long time after encountering them. Plato's cave: the prisoners watching shadows on the wall who mistake them for reality. This metaphor has structured Western epistemology for 2,400 years. Everyone who has read it carries a version of it, and the metaphor shapes how they think about perception, reality, and education.",
    "The root metaphor for computation is itself spatial: computing is processing, data is stored, programs are run, code is executed. Each of these is a metaphor from physical or temporal experience applied to abstract information processes. The metaphors make computation legible — and they also shape what problems seem natural to solve and what solutions seem possible.",
    "Lakoff and Johnson argue that the most fundamental human metaphors are grounded in embodied experience. More is up — we pour more water and the level rises. Good is up — we feel down when sad and up when happy. These orientational metaphors connect abstract concepts to physical experiences that are universal to human embodiment. They suggest that abstract thought is not separable from bodily experience — it grows from it.",
