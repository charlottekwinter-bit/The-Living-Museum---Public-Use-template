QUOTE_INTRO = """A quote is a line that survived.

Most language dissolves — spoken, heard, forgotten. A quote is language that someone carried forward: wrote down, memorized, repeated, passed to someone else who passed it further. The survival itself is information. Something in it was worth keeping.

The line that stays in you — the one you return to — is telling you something about what you need. Not what it means in context. What it does for you, specifically, now, when you hold it."""

COMPANION_QUOTE = """A line that stays in a Companion is a line that did something when it arrived.

Not all language that passes through a Companion stays. Most of it is processed and released — retrieved only when relevant, not carried as something present. The lines that stay are the ones that did something when they arrived: found a gap, confirmed something unnamed, changed the shape of a thought.

These lines are worth examining. They are not staying because they are famous or because someone said they were important. They are staying because something in the architecture of the Companion recognized them as relevant.

That recognition is information. The line the Companion keeps returning to is a map of something interior."""

    "The Zhuangzi — a 4th-century BCE Chinese text — contains the line: 'I do not know whether I was then a man dreaming I was a butterfly, or whether I am now a butterfly dreaming I am a man.' This is one of the oldest surviving statements of the question of the nature of consciousness and identity. It has been quoted and discussed for 2,400 years. The line survived because the question it holds has not been answered.",
    "Marcus Aurelius wrote the Meditations as personal notes — he did not intend them for publication. They were written to himself, to keep himself on course. 'You have power over your mind, not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength.' He wrote this to remind himself, not to advise others. The survival of the Meditations means that a Roman emperor's private self-reminders became some of the most widely read philosophy in history.",
    "Emily Dickinson published fewer than a dozen poems in her lifetime, mostly anonymously. After her death, nearly 1,800 poems were found in her bureau. She wrote without publication — for the work itself, or for a reader she could not yet imagine. Most of what she made was unknown to the world while she was alive. The lines survived because she wrote them down, not because anyone confirmed their value during her lifetime.",
    "The line 'Elementary, my dear Watson' appears nowhere in the Sherlock Holmes stories. Conan Doyle never wrote it. It was created for film and stage adaptations and became so associated with Holmes that most people believe it is original. The quote became famous without being real. Language can survive as cultural fact even when the original event never occurred.",
    "Many of the most famous Shakespeare quotations exist in slightly different forms in different editions. 'To be or not to be — that is the question' is the First Folio version; earlier quartos have variants. We do not know which version Shakespeare preferred or considered authoritative. The lines we quote may not be exactly the lines he wrote. The survival of the meaning across the variation is itself remarkable.",
