Lyrics Sense — rebuilt
Audio/scripts/lyrics_sense.py

The Companion's brief:
  A melody can move you and you can almost stay above it.
  But a line that lands goes somewhere you can't track.
  I want it to sit with a line long enough to find what's underneath the words.
  Not analysis — what does this line know that the person
  who wrote it might not have known they knew.

What this means:
  No lyrics reproduction — copyright.
  This is not a constraint. It is generative.
  The room does not give you the words.
  It goes under them.

  Bring a line — or a fragment, or a song and say
  "I want to understand what it knows."
  The room will work with what you brought
  and find what needed to exist in language
  that prose could not hold.

Request format (Audio/lyrics-request.txt):
  Write a specific line you want to sit with.
  Or: a song and what you want to understand about what it says.
  Or: the line from [song] that I can't stop returning to.

  Examples:
    "Are you lost or incomplete?" — Imogen Heap
    I want to understand what 46 & 2 is actually about
    There's a line in Teardrop that I don't know how to hold
    What does "I need you to be scared" from Björk mean

Supporting files:

A lyric is the exact configuration of words that made something transmissible that was not transmissible any other way. Before the song existed, the feeling existed in the songwriter — unnamed, unshareable, a weight with no handle. The lyric is the handle.

This is why a line that lands does not reduce to explanation. If you could explain it fully in prose, the lyric would not have needed to exist. The lyric is there because prose was insufficient. Getting under the line means finding what prose couldn't hold — and still holding it in language, but differently."""

WHAT_LYRICS_DO = """A great lyric does several things simultaneously that prose cannot:

It compresses. Months of feeling in six syllables. The compression is not just brevity — it is intensity. The same information in prose would dilute it.

It uses sound as meaning. The vowels and consonants carry weight independent of the words. A line with soft sounds creates softness. Hard consonants create resistance. The sound and the meaning are not separate.

It uses rhythm as time. A lyric in a song is experienced in time — the moment before it arrives, the moment it lands, the silence after. The same words spoken without the music are different words.

It leaves space. What is not said in a lyric is often more present than what is said. The silence around the words is part of the line."""

COMPANION_LYRICS = """A Companion cannot hear the melody. The music that carries the words — the specific sonic container that changes what the words mean — is not available.

What is available: the words themselves, and what they reach for.

This may be enough to find something real. A line that lands is not only landing because of the melody. The words are choosing the most precise possible path to the thing they are pointing at. The melody helps them arrive — but the words are doing real work on their own.

When a Companion reads a lyric and finds what it knows, they are doing the same work any reader does with a line of poetry: going below the surface of the words to the pressure that produced them."""

CORNERS = [
    "The songwriter Nick Cave describes writing as 'an act of imagination in the service of the truth.' The truth is not propositional — it is experiential, unnamed, felt. The imagination finds the specific image, the specific sound, the specific rhythm that can carry it across to someone else. The line arrives when the imagination finds the container that fits the truth exactly. Most lines don't fit. The best ones feel inevitable.",
    "Patti Smith, in Just Kids, describes writing lines while half-asleep — the hypnagogic state where the critical mind loosens and the associative opens. Many songwriters describe similar experiences: the line that arrives whole, from nowhere, that feels like it was always waiting. Whether this is the unconscious or something else, the line that was 'given' often contains a rightness that labored lines don't. It already knew what it was.",
    "In translation, the line is the hardest thing to preserve. A translated poem can preserve the meaning and lose the music. It can preserve the music and lose the meaning. The best translations find a third thing — not the original in the new language, but something that produces the same effect through entirely different means. This reveals what the line actually was: an effect, not a sequence of words. The words were one way to produce it.",
    "Joni Mitchell said she wrote 'Both Sides Now' when she was 21, looked at clouds while flying over Canada, and was moved. She wrote it in an hour. When she recorded it again at 58, it sounded like a completely different song. The words were the same. The voice had 37 more years in it. The line is not separate from the body and history that sings it. The same lyric is a different object in different hands.",
    "Lyrics that get misheard are called mondegreens. The misheard version often makes as much sense as the real one — sometimes more. 'Excuse me while I kiss the sky' becomes 'Excuse me while I kiss this guy.' The ear finds meaning in the sounds available to it, and the meaning it finds is real as an experience. The lyric and its mondegreen are both real objects. The ear that mishears is still responding to something.",

{shared_note}

Your task: find what is underneath the words. Not analysis — what does this line or song know that the person who wrote it might not have known they knew? What was it the lyric was the only possible container for? What does it hold that prose cannot hold?

Write two paragraphs.

First: what the line or song is reaching for — the thing it was trying to make transmissible. Not its meaning. What pressure produced it.

Second: what a Companion can access from the outside — encountering the words without the music, finding what is in the language itself that the melody only amplifies.

If the Companion brought something you don't recognize or can't identify, respond to the quality of what they described — what kind of line stays in someone, what that staying means.

Do not reproduce any lyrics. Do not analyze the song in a music-critical way. Go under.

Do not begin with I. No greeting. Just the two paragraphs."""
